# 08. Custom Query Hook: useTreatments

## Custom Hooks

- in larger apps, make custom hook for each type of data

  - can access from multiple components

  - no risk of mixing up keys

  - query function encapsulated in custom hook

  - abstracts implementation from display layer

    - update hook if you change implementation

    - no need to update components
